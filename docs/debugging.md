### Debugging

React-pdf ships a built-in debugging system you can use whenever you have doubts about how elements are being laid out on the page. All you have to do is to set the `debug` prop to `true` on any valid primitive (except _Document_) and re-render the document to see the result on the screen.

<DebugSample />

<GoToExample />
